# Tmux
summery: Tmux is a terminal multiplexer; it allows you to create several "pseudo terminals" from a single terminal. This is very useful for running     multiple programs with a single connection, such as when you're remotely connecting to a machine using Secure Shell (SSH).

Step 1) Install Tmux 
Step 2) To install Tmux in linux 
          $ sudo apt install tmux
